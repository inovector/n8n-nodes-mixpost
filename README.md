# n8n-nodes-mixpost

This is an n8n community node that lets you integrate [Mixpost](https://mixpost.app) with your n8n workflows.

Mixpost is a self-hosted social media management software that helps you schedule and manage your social media content across multiple platforms including Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube, and more.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation platform.

## 🚀 Installation

### Automatic - From n8n UI (Recommended)

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Community Nodes** in your n8n instance
2. Click **Install**
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-mixpost` in the package name field
4. Click **Install** to add it to your n8n instance

### Manual - Command Line Installation

Use this method if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

#### Docker Installation

Access your Docker container:
```bash
docker exec -it <n8n_container_name> sh
```

Create `~/.n8n/nodes` if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
npm init -y
```

Install the Mixpost node package:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-mixpost
```

Restart your n8n instance to load the new node.

#### Non-Docker Installation

Navigate to ` ~/.n8n`, and check if a `custom` folder exists. If not, create it, then add a new package.json file inside.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.n8n/custom
npm init -y
```

Then, install the Mixpost node package:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-mixpost
```

Restart n8n to load the new node.
